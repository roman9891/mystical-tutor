        This site was developed to make it easier for users to find related or synergistic cards by making use of a tagging system.
        It uses <a href="https://scryfall.com/docs/api">Scryfall's API</a> to find cards and my own tagging system to curate related searches.
        The tag system is ongoing and admittedly an imprecise process. In spite of their flaws, these tags still provide a quick way to discover other cards.
        A list of all currently implemented tags can be found in the documentation.
